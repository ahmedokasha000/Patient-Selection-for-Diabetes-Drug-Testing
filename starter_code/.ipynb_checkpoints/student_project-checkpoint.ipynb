    "**Context**: You are a data scientist for an exciting unicorn healthcare startup that has created a groundbreaking diabetes drug that is ready for clinical trial testing. It is a very unique and sensitive drug that requires administering the drug over at least 5-7 days of time in the hospital with frequent monitoring/testing and patient medication adherence training with a mobile application. You have been provided a patient dataset from a client partner and are tasked with building a predictive model that can identify which type of patients the company should focus their efforts testing this drug on. Target patients are people that are likely to be in the hospital for this duration of time and will not incur significant additional costs for administering this drug to the patient and monitoring.  \n",

The challenge is that there are many codes that map to the same or similar drug. You are provided with the ndc drug lookup file https://github.com/udacity/nd320-c1-emr-data-starter/tree/master/project/data_schema_references/ndc_lookup_table.csv derived from the National Drug Codes List site(https://ndclist.com/).

    "the ROC AUC relations is used to compare different algorithm performance depending on calculating the area under the curve of the AUC plot.As long as this area increases, this means that the algorithm is performing better and that the TPR and FPR both are better in one algorithm than another. \n",
    "The result in our case = 0.7262468962506119. If another architecture of the model was tried and this number increased. this gives an indication that the new model is doing better.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1- F1 Score \n",
    "the overall F1 score =0.75 which gives an overall bet the average precision and recall of each class and the more this value is near one, this gives an indication that the model performance is getting better.\n",
    "### 2- Class Precision, Recall\n",
    "from the results, the overall Precision = 0.75 and the overall recall = 0.75, this means that over the model classes the FP=FN.\n",
    "class 0: the result of the precision = 0.79 and the recall=0.84 meaning that the FP is slightly higher than FN in this class\n",
    "class 1: the result of the precision = 0.68 and the recall=0.61 meaning that the FN is slightly higher than FP in this class\n",
    "### non-technical overview\n",
    "because the main goal is to choose patients that can decrease the costs for the company as possible, in this case, it's more important to avoid any False Positive results rather than the False Negatives, this means that if the model it's better for the model to predict that higher percentage of the patient will require more costs rather than predicting more people will require lower costs compared to the real values.\n",
    "As a result, this means that the recall should be as high as possible and is more important than the precision\n",
    "### future improvements\n",
    "for future improvements, there is many parts that can be optimized to give better results like\n",
    "1 - VariationalGaussianProcess layer can be added instead of the normal distribution layer in the model, this can give us a better probability for the mean and standard deviation increasing the overall performance of the model\n",
    "2- the architecture of the model can be improved by looking to more architectures that have been built by the community for a similar problem\n",
    "3- batch_normalization can be added to increase the speed, accuracy in the training process\n",
    "4- trying to reduce the unnecessary numerical, categorical features as possible can lead to increasing the performance of the model\n"
